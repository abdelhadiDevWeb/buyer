- **offer.ts**: Updated offer API to support tender offers and added tender-specific methods

### 2. Backend Changes (Server)

- **Proper error handling** for tender bid submissions
- **Notification system** integration for tender owners

#### Offer Service

## How It Works

### 1. Tender Display
- Users can view tender details including:
  - Maximum budget
  - Current lowest bid
  - Tender requirements
  - Images and videos
  - Owner information

### 2. Bidding Process
1. **User enters their lowest price** in the bid input field
2. **System validates** that the bid is:
   - Lower than current lowest bid
   - Not higher than maximum budget
   - Greater than zero
3. **Tender bid is submitted** via TendersAPI
4. **Offer record is created** for tracking purposes
5. **Notifications are sent** to tender owner
6. **UI is updated** with new bid information

### 3. Offer Tracking
- **Offers are displayed** in the Offers page
- **Users can view** their submitted offers
- **Tender owners can see** all offers for their tenders
- **Status tracking** for offer acceptance/rejection

## API Endpoints

### Tender Endpoints
- `GET /api/tender` - Get all active tenders
- `GET /api/tender/:id` - Get specific tender details
- `POST /api/tender/:id/bid` - Submit tender bid
- `GET /api/tender/:id/bids` - Get tender bids
- `GET /api/tender/bidder/:userId/bids` - Get user's tender bids

### Offer Endpoints
- `POST /api/offers/:id` - Create offer (supports both bids and tenders)
- `GET /api/offers/tender/:tenderId` - Get offers for specific tender
- `GET /api/offers/user/:userId` - Get user's offers
- `GET /api/offers/:id` - Get offers by bid ID

## Validation Rules

### Tender Bidding
- Bid amount must be **lower** than current lowest bid
- Bid amount cannot exceed maximum budget
- Bid amount must be greater than zero
- Users cannot bid on their own tenders
- Tender must be active (not ended)

### Error Handling
- Clear error messages for validation failures
- Proper HTTP status codes
- User-friendly error descriptions
- Graceful fallbacks for API failures

## Testing

A test script (`test-tender-bidding.js`) is provided to verify the complete flow:
- Tender details retrieval
- Tender bid submission
- Offer creation
- Offers retrieval
- User offers retrieval

## Usage Instructions

### For Buyers
1. Navigate to a tender details page
2. Read the bidding instructions
3. Enter your lowest possible price
4. Click "Soumettre une Offre" (Submit Offer)
5. View your offers in the Offers page

### For Tender Owners
1. Create a tender with maximum budget
2. Receive notifications for new offers
3. View all offers in the Offers page
4. Award the tender to the lowest bidder

## Technical Notes

### Database Schema
- **TenderBid**: Stores actual tender bids with validation
- **Offer**: Stores offer records for tracking (supports both bids and tenders)
- **Tender**: Contains tender information and current lowest bid

### Security
- Authentication required for bid submission
- Owner validation to prevent self-bidding
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting for bid submissions

### Performance
- Efficient database queries with proper indexing
- Caching for frequently accessed data
- Optimized API responses
- Background processing for notifications

## Future Enhancements

1. **Real-time updates** for bid changes
2. **Bid history tracking** with timestamps
3. **Advanced filtering** for offers
4. **Bulk operations** for offer management
5. **Analytics dashboard** for tender performance

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Bid not accepted**: Check if bid is lower than current lowest bid
2. **Validation errors**: Ensure bid amount is within valid range
3. **API errors**: Check authentication and network connectivity
4. **Display issues**: Clear browser cache and refresh page

### Debug Information
- Check browser console for client-side errors
- Check server logs for API errors
- Verify database connectivity
- Test with provided test script

## Conclusion

The tender bidding system is now fully functional with proper validation, error handling, and user experience enhancements. Users can submit their lowest price offers, and the system ensures fair competition by enforcing the lowest-price-wins rule.
